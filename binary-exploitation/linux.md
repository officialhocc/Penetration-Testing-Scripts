### richsanchez' Exploit Mitigation Technologies Series

This series is absolutely fantastic as it covers the basics of how the simple exploit mitigation's came about, and some methods that have been developed to bypass them.  I'd highly recommend this series.[  
**Exploit Mitigation Techniques - Data Execution Prevention \(DEP\)**](https://0x00sec.org/t/exploit-mitigation-techniques-data-execution-prevention-dep/4634)**        
**[**Exploit Mitigation Techniques - Stack Canaries**](https://0x00sec.org/t/exploit-mitigation-techniques-stack-canaries/5085)**

Nothing major in this publication but goes through finding interesting gadgets within a binary that wouldn't normally be picked up by classic tools.



# Heap Exploitation

### Unlink Exploit

[**The Art of Exploiting Heap overflow Part 6**](https://medium.com/@c0ngwang/the-art-of-exploiting-heap-overflow-part-6-14410c9ba6a6)   
There's no need to over-complicate the unlink exploit.  It's quite simple but unfortunately so many guides insist on showing you the entire structure of the heap.  Don't get me wrong, you're going to need to understand it, but at the end of the day you're trying to understand a fundamental exploit, and a lot of that gets in the way.  This blog post is concise, and gets the point across quickly.
